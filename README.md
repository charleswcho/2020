## Overview

This project was inspired by 1010!. 2020 was created using JavaScript and jQuery.

## Specifics


### Drag and Drop

* jQuery UI Draggable utilizes the helper option to select multiple HTML elements to drag
* jQuery UI Droppables drop callback checks for if move is valid then “places” the piece by changing the color of all the droppable elements under the piece


## Future Directions

### Instructions

Directions would help clarify the game to people that aren't familiar with 1010!

### Losing

A prompt to notify the user if they lost based on if there are no more moves available.
